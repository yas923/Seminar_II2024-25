            The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in 1984. The Department, since its
            inception, has maintained a steady growth in every sphere of its activities and played an important role in
            bringing a vibrant and Forward-looking academic environment within the University. It is a premier
            institution offering high quality undergraduate and postgraduate engineering courses as well as providing an
            excellent infrastructure and facilities for advanced research and consultancy. The Department of Computer
            Science &amp; Engineering strives for excellence in creating, applying, and imparting knowledge in computer
            science and engineering through comprehensive educational programs, research in collaboration with industry
            and government, dissemination through scholarly publications, and service to professional societies, the
            community, the state, and the Nation. The Department has MoU with IIT Bombay for Distance Education Program,
            Oracle Corp. for WDP Program, IBM for PAP Program and Microsoft for Academic alliance. The Department is
            also a recognized research center of S.R.T.M. University, Nanded.
